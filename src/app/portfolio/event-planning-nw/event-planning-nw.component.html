    This was my first full stack SPA project using the MEAN stack. It was my
    humble beginning doing full stack work. The project was the initial design
    for a local event planning entrepeneur but work on it stopped in order to
    perform a redesign later on. It was built with Angular 5 using Bootstrap 4.
    It includes APIs for authorized CRUD operations, authentication and access
    management with automatic JWT renewal (via OAuth), and simple/complex forms
    with custom validation. More attention was paid to the back-end
    administrative side with most data hosted in MongoDB document stores hosted
    by mLab. This project is no longer maintained but kept for reference only.
