    This was a mock up SPA project using the MEAN stack. The project was the initial design
    for a local event planning entrepeneur but work on it stopped in order to
    perform a redesign later on. It was built with Angular 5 using Bootstrap 4.
    Getting to know more Bootstrap 4 features was one of the primary goals.
    It includes APIs for authorized CRUD operations, authentication and access
    management with automatic JWT renewal (via OAuth), and simple/complex forms
    with custom validation. More attention was paid to the back-end
    administrative side with most data hosted in MongoDB document stores hosted
    by mLab. This mock project is no longer maintained but kept for reference only.
